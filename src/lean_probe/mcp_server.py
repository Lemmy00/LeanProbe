"""MCP stdio server for LeanProbe.

The server advertises agent-facing ``instructions`` on connect, reports the real
LeanProbe version in ``serverInfo``, and exposes a small, action-oriented tool
set. ``lean_check`` is the low-friction default (verify any snippet);
``lean_check_target`` is the fast warm-environment path for project files.
